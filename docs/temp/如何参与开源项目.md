### Do you like to write?（写作）

- Write and improve the project’s documentation
- Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
- Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list
- Write tutorials for the project, like PyPA’s contributors did
- Write a translation for the project’s documentation

### Do you like organizing?（组织）

- Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized
- Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones, like @nzakas did for ESLint
- Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward


### Do you like to code?

- Find an open issue to tackle, like @dianjin did for Leaflet
- Ask if you can help write a new feature
- Automate project setup
- Improve tooling and testing（可以写一些测试用例，或为开源项目添加测试，或完善测试，例如 30s-code）
Do you like helping people?
-Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow (like this Postgres example) or Reddit
- Answer questions for people on open issues（像之前在 iview 那做得事情）
- Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels

### You don’t just have to work on software projects!

While “open source” often refers to software, you can collaborate on just about anything. There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open source projects.

For example:

@sindresorhus curates a list of “awesome” lists
@h5bp maintains a list of potential interview questions for front-end developer candidates
@stuartlynn and @nicole-a-tesla made a collection of fun facts about puffins

Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

- **Author**: The person/s or organization that created the project
- **Owner**: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
- **Maintainers**: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
- **Contributors**: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project
- **Community Members**: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction

A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

- **LICENSE**: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
- **README**: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.
- **CONTRIBUTING**: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- **Other documentation**: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.

Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

- **Issue tracker**: Where people discuss issues related to the project.
Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.
- **Discussion forums or mailing lists**: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
- **Synchronous chat channel**: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

## 时间安排

寻找固定的时间，去给开源项目贡献。

Contributing to open source happens at all levels, across projects. You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look.

Instead, start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.

You might scan a README and find a broken link or a typo. Or you’re a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That’s what open source is all about!

## 寻找路径

You can also use one of the following resources to help you discover and contribute to new projects:

- GitHub Explore
- Open Source Friday
- First Timers Only
- CodeTriage
- 24 Pull Requests
- Up For Grabs
- Contributor-ninja
- First Contributions
- SourceSort

## A checklist before you contribute


Meets the definition of open source

- [ ] Does it have a license? Usually, there is a file called LICENSE in the root of the repository.

Project actively accepts contributions

Look at the commit activity on the master branch. On GitHub, you can see this information on a repository’s homepage.

- [ ] When was the latest commit?

- [ ] How many contributors does the project have?

- [ ] How often do people commit? (On GitHub, you can find this by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)

Next, look at the project’s issues.

- [ ] How many open issues are there?

- [ ] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?

- [ ] Is there active discussion on the issues?

- [ ] Are the issues recent?

- [ ] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
Now do the same for the project’s pull requests.

- [ ] How many open pull requests are there?

- [ ] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?

- [ ] Is there active discussion on the pull requests?

- [ ] Are the pull requests recent?

- [ ] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)

Project is welcoming

A project that is friendly and welcoming signals that they will be receptive to new contributors.

- [ ] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?

- [ ] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?

- [ ] Do pull requests get reviewed?

- [ ] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

### How to submit a contribution

#### Communicating effectively

Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.

Give context. Help others get quickly up to speed. If you’re running into an error, explain what you’re trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you’re suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it’d be useful to the project (not just to you!).

#### Gathering context

Opening an issue
You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

Report an error you can’t solve yourself
Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
Propose a new feature or other project idea
Tips for communicating on issues:

If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.
